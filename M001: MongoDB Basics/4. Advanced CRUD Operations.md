- $__gt__   - Greater Than
- $__lt__   - Less Than
- $__gte__  - Greater Than Equal to
- $__lte__  - Less Than Equal to

`{ <field>: { <operator> : <value> }}`
   
Problem: Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was not Subscriber.<br>
`db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": { "$ne": "Subscriber" } }).pretty()`

- $__or__   - Atleast one of the query clauses is matched.
- $__nor__  - Fail to match both given clauses.
- $__not__  - Negate the query requirement.

##### Implicit $and
$and is used as the default operator when an operator is not specified.<br>
`{sector: 'Mobile Food Vendor - 881', result: 'Warning'}` is same as<br>
`{"$and": [
    {sector: 'Mobile Food Vendor - 881'}, 
    {result: 'Warning'}
]}`

Problem: Find all documents where airplanes CR2 or A81 left or landed in the KZN airport.<br>
`db.routes.find({ "$and": [ { "$or" :[ { "dst_airport": "KZN" },
                                    { "src_airport": "KZN" }
                                  ] },
                          { "$or" :[ { "airplane": "CR2" },
                                     { "airplane": "A81" } ] }
                         ]}).pretty()`
