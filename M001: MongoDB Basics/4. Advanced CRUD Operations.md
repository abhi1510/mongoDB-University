## Comparision Operators

- $__eq__   - EQual to
- $__ne__   - Not Equal to
- $__gt__   - Greater Than
- $__lt__   - Less Than
- $__gte__  - Greater Than Equal to
- $__lte__  - Less Than Equal to

`{ <field>: { <operator> : <value> }}`
   
Problem: Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was not Subscriber.<br>
`db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": { "$ne": "Subscriber" } }).pretty()`


## Logical Operators

- $__and__  - Match all of the specified query clauses.
- $__or__   - Atleast one of the query clauses is matched.
- $__nor__  - Fail to match both given clauses.
- $__not__  - Negate the query requirement.

##### Implicit $and
$and is used as the default operator when an operator is not specified.<br>
`{sector: 'Mobile Food Vendor - 881', result: 'Warning'}` is same as<br>
`{"$and": [
    {sector: 'Mobile Food Vendor - 881'}, 
    {result: 'Warning'}
]}`

Problem: Find all documents where airplanes CR2 or A81 left or landed in the KZN airport.<br>
`db.routes.find({ "$and": [ { "$or" :[ { "dst_airport": "KZN" },
                                    { "src_airport": "KZN" }
                                  ] },
                          { "$or" :[ { "airplane": "CR2" },
                                     { "airplane": "A81" } ] }
                         ]}).pretty()`

### Quiz Solutions

**Quiz 1.** How many businesses in the sample_training.inspections dataset have the inspection result "Out of Business" and belong to the "Home Improvement Contractor - 100" sector?<br>
```
db.inspections.find({
	result: 'Out of Business', 
	sector: 'Home Improvement Contractor - 100'
}).count()
```
OR <br>
```
db.inspections.find({ '$and': [{
	result: 'Out of Business', 
	sector: 'Home Improvement Contractor - 100'
}]}).count()
```


**Quiz 2.** Return all documents from the sample_training.inspections collection where the inspection date is either "Feb 20 2015", or "Feb 21 2015" and the company is not part of the "Cigarette Retail Dealer - 127" sector?<br>
```
db.inspections.find({ "$or": [ 
	{ "date": "Feb 20 2015" },
	{ "date": "Feb 21 2015" } 
],
"sector": { "$ne": "Cigarette Retail Dealer - 127" }}).pretty()
```

### Lab Solutions

**Lab 1.** How many zips in the sample_training.zips dataset are neither over-populated nor under-populated? <br>
 In this case, we consider population of more than 1,000,000 to be over- populated and less than 5,000 to be under-populated.<br>
```
db.zips.find({'$nor': [
	{'pop': {'$lt': 5000}}, 
	{'pop': {'$gt': 1000000}}
]}).count()
```
 
 **Lab 2.** How many companies in the sample_training.companies dataset were either founded in 2004 and either have the social category_code or web category_code,
or were founded in the month of October and also either have the social category_code or web category_code?<br>
```
db.companies.find({'$or': [
	{'$and': [
		{founded_year: 2004}, 
		{'$or': [
			{'category_code': 'social'}, 
			{'category_code': 'web'}
		]}
	]},
	{'$and': [
		{founded_month: 10}, 
		{'$or': [
			{'category_code': 'social'}, 
			{'category_code': 'web'}
		]}
	]}
]})
```

## Expressive Query Operator

$__expr__ allows the use of aggregation expressions within the query language.

`{ $expr: { <expression> } }`

$__expr__ allows us to use variables and conditional statements.

Can we compare fields within the same document?

Find all documents where the trip started and ended at the same station:
```
db.trips.find({ "$expr": { 
	"$eq": [ "$end station id", "$start station id"] 
}}).count()
```

Find all documents where the trip lasted longer than 1200 seconds, and started and ended at the same station
```
db.trips.find({ "$expr": { 
	"$and": [ 
		{ "$gt": [ "$tripduration", 1200 ]},
                { "$eq": [ "$end station id", "$start station id" ]}
	]
}}).count()
```

### Quiz Solutions

**Quiz 1.** What are some of the uses for the $ sign in MQL?
- $ denotes an operator.
- $ signifies that you are looking at the value of that field rather than the field name.

**Quiz 2.** Which of the following statements will find all the companies that have more employees than the year in which they were founded?
```
db.companies.find(
    { "$expr": { "$lt": [ "$founded_year", "$number_of_employees" ] } }
).count()
```
```
db.companies.find(
    { "$expr": { "$gt": [ "$number_of_employees", "$founded_year" ]} }
).count()
```

**Lab** How many companies in the sample_training.companies collection have the same permalink as their twitter_username?
```
db.companies.find(
	{"$expr": { "$eq": [ "$permalink", "$twitter_username" ]}}
).count()
```
